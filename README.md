# About Dataset
**Bar history**: In the spring of 2016, we decided to open a beer bar that would be fun to return to for many years. To do this, we have done a lot of work. There are 30 taps on the board on the board of interesting beer from European, American and Russian new wave breweries, shelves and refrigerators for three hundred bottles, as well as the best cheese from regional cheese makers. In December of the same year, Nelson Sauvin opened - a spacious and cozy two-story bar with large windows in the very center of Yekaterinburg. The bar is open not only for experimental and Untappd check-ins, but also for Friday hangouts, dates or meeting with grandma. ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ In addition, we are engaged in the import of beer, which, in our opinion, is not enough in Russia.
